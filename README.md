# Scripts for differential gene expression analysis and transcriptome and proteome correlation analysis 
This repository has the scripts used for:
1- Differential expression analysis of RNA sequencing data of mouse pancreatic islets of Langerhans in two groups (Control and Cnot3 beta cell specific KO). 
2- Transcriptome and proteome correlation analysis. 
3- generating heatmap representing expression of disallowed genes in Control and Cnot3 beta cell specific KO islets
